# potential-adventure

Used the generated name suggested by github for this repo. Going to try using 11ty 
(via the [jet](https://github.com/marcamos/jet) template) for a story-telling blog. 
Previously I was using mkdocs which just wasn't the right feel. This will allow me
to try out Tailwind and see what I can do with it!
