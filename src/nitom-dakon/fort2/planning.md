- little to no soil, force farming via water dumping
  - plump helmet: wine, food
  - pig tail: ale, thread
  - cave wheat: beer, flour
  - sweet pod: rum, sugar/syrup
- plant workshops
  - Still: Brew drnk from plant -(barrel/pot)-> alcohol
  - Farmer Workship: Process Plants (Barrel) -(barrel)-> syrup
  - Quern: -(bag)-> flour/sugar
  - Millstone: -(bag)-> flour/sugar !! requires power
- cloth is important for bags. separate cloth industry (or more pigtail overhead)
  - pig tail plots -> pig tail
  - farm wrksp: pig tail -> Plant Processing --> pig tail thread
  - loom: pig tail thread -> weave thread into cloth --> pig tail cloth
  - clothier: pig tail cloth -> make bag --> pig tail bag
- prefer light aquifer, set up well 1st thing
- bring ore + metal forge + coal for coke
- bring some wood, just enough for beds
- set pop cap to 20

***

Area has a pleasant forest in the northwest and then is barren soil rest of map -- however an
interesting feature is a short mesa/palteau in the middle of the area. This is where we we build
the trade depot on top of and have the fortress underneath.

***

Suddenly liason and traders from mountainhomes arrive! 701-07-15

The world is the same as ever.

Hurriedly we built a trade depot from bronze bars and olvine. It will be a temporary depot until
we get dug into the plateau.

From the liason we request leather, cloth, metal bars, animals, general clothing, seeds and food.

They are requesting a few items. The ones of note that we could easily produce:

Goblets HIGH demand, $$$ (+215% value)
Windows MED demand, $$ (+169% value)

Basically, in the eastern biome there is plenty of sand. Glass industry could be very profitable,
be able to make windows and goblets (as long as we have fuel for it!)

We were making some bronze goblets already, so those are good to trade right now. hopefully they
have something good to offer..  We were able to trade 9 bronze goblets for some rope, a water
buffalo and a bull.

Migrants arrive right at the beginning of winter. We tapped into the aquifer to begin filling the
cistern for the well. We also hollowed out a large space to be able to haul all our equipment
into the fortress, and to secure it from the wild beasts.

Right now, the traders are still close by -- they seem to have gotten distracted killing some
langurs on their way out and have stalled.

***

Traded with elves in spring.. for some animals which we butchered and some more barrels/buckets and
other wooden things.

Traded with humans in summer. The request:

Ammunition HIGH demand, +180% value
Earrings HIGH demand, +193%
Maces MED demand, +180%

We traded away the last of our goblets in exchange for some food (can never have too much), and
some barrels. It should be pretty easy to make some glass or metal earrings and hopefully we
can get a pretty good haul.

More migrants arrived and now we're at the capacity we're keeping until the fort can sustain itself.
The apartments continue to come along, we've got half of the dwarves assigned. Each apartment has
a bedroom, dining room and study. This is a nice luxury for our dwarves. 

The well is still dry but slowly filling up. The aquifer is very weak and I think that's partially
due to being in a desert. 

No farm yet! Had to dig an access tunnel for dumping water above the farm area but there end up
being too many wild animals in the forest area of the map (where standing water is) to be able to
dump water safely/quickly. I think it will be best if we can just use the well.

The hospital is designated. Need to get soap still.

No barracks or military. I want to get this started soon, but want to have all the bedrooms completed
and at least be in a stable state.
