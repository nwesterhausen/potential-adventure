***

Area has a pleasant forest in the northwest and then is barren soil rest of map -- however an
interesting feature is a short mesa/palteau in the middle of the area. This is where we we build
the trade depot on top of and have the fortress underneath.

Suddenly liason and traders from mountainhomes arrive! 701-07-15

The world is the same as ever.

Hurriedly we built a trade depot from bronze bars and olvine. It will be a temporary depot until
we get dug into the plateau.

From the liason we request leather, cloth, metal bars, animals, general clothing, seeds and food.

They are requesting a few items. The ones of note that we could easily produce:

Goblets HIGH demand, $$$ (+215% value)
Windows MED demand, $$ (+169% value)

Basically, in the eastern biome there is plenty of sand. Glass industry could be very profitable,
be able to make windows and goblets (as long as we have fuel for it!)

We were making some bronze goblets already, so those are good to trade right now. hopefully they
have something good to offer..  We were able to trade 9 bronze goblets for some rope, a water
buffalo and a bull.

Migrants arrive right at the beginning of winter. We tapped into the aquifer to begin filling the
cistern for the well. We also hollowed out a large space to be able to haul all our equipment
into the fortress, and to secure it from the wild beasts.

Right now, the traders are still close by -- they seem to have gotten distracted killing some
langurs on their way out and have stalled.
