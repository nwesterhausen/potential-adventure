"I wish to make something. It's frustrating."He is frustrated after being unable to practice a craft for too long. Within the last season, he was angry dwelling upon getting into an argument. He was content remembering being near to a waterfall. He was enraptured after communing with Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. He was interested having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He was content after eating a fine dish. He was annoyed at the lack of dining tables. He felt satisfied at work. He was exasperated when caught in the rain. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He was embarrassed after sleeping without a proper room. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body.
