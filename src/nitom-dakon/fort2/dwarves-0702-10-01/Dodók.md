***

"I wish to make something. It isn't boring."He doesn't feel anything after being unable to practice a craft for too long. Within the last season, he felt pleasure remembering a fine Table. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He was blissful after sleeping in a good bedroom. He was content after eating a fine dish. He was blissful dining in a very good dining room. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He felt pleasure near his own fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He was enraptured after communing with Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. He felt sympathy remembering bringing somebody to rest in bed. He didn't feel anything having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. He felt satisfied after getting into an argument. He didn't feel anything after being unable to argue for too long. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He felt satisfied at work. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt pleasure near a fine Furnace. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied remembering getting into an argument. He was irritated dwelling upon clothes rot off of his body. He was grouchy when caught in the rain. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He was uneasy after being unable to pray to Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts for too long. He was irritated to have clothes rot off of his body. He was irritated to be wearing old clothing. He didn't feel anything after sleeping without a proper room. He felt satisfied at work. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He felt fondness remembering making a friend. He felt satisfied remembering improving intimidation. He was content after eating a pretty decent meal. 
***

He is an ardent worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. 
***

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Stockade of Shanks. He is a former member of The Righteous Cult. He is a former member of The Amazing Cuts. He is a former member of The Helmed Company. He arrived at Tathurèrith on the 28th of Sandstone in the year 701. 
***

He is sixty-seven years old, born on the 24th of Sandstone in the year 635. 
***

He is thin and weak. His sideburns are clean-shaven. His very long moustache is neatly combed. His very long beard is arranged in double braids. His long hair is braided. He has a scratchy voice. His teeth are crowded. His eyelashes are extremely long. His free-lobed ears are somewhat splayed out. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver. His nose is somewhat long. 
***

He is almost never sick, but he is clumsy and very weak. 
***

Dodók Mörulkor likes serpentine, gold, schorl, giant deer hoof, crowns, catapult parts, the words of The Lark of Crabs, the sound of The Phrases of Sparkling and the sight of The Saffron of Styling. When possible, he prefers to consume giant tortoise, clownfish and rice beer. He absolutely detests blood gnats. 
***

He has a great musical sense and very good intuition, but he has a questionable spatial sense, a poor ability to manage or understand social relationships and a large deficit of willpower. 
***

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally values eloquence, finds artwork boring, values decorum, dignity and proper behavior and does not care about family one way or the other. He dreams of crafting a masterwork someday. 
***

He is a dyed-in-the-wool quarreler, never missing a chance to lash out in verbal hostility, and he is bothered by this since he values friendship. He is incredibly brave in the face of looming danger, perhaps a bit foolhardy. He doesn't tend to hold on to grievances. He is not inherently proud of his talents and accomplishments. He is very humble. He doesn't handle stress well. He doesn't seek out excitement. He can occasionally lose focus on the matter at hand. He sometimes acts with little determination and confidence. He is often cheerful. He isn't particularly curious about the world. He generally acts impartially and is rarely moved to mercy. He has a noticeable lack of perseverance. He has a sense of duty. He exhales sharply when he becomes exasperated. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. He doesn't really care about anything anymore. 
***

Overall, he is unfocused by unmet needs. He is not distracted after being away from people. He is not distracted after being unoccupied. He is unfocused after doing nothing creative. He is unfocused after being unable to acquire something. He is level-headed after drinking. He is level-headed after eating a good meal. He is unfocused after being unable to fight. He is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not distracted after being unable to argue. He is unfocused after being unable to be extravagant. He is unfocused after being unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. He is unfocused after being unable to make merry. He is distracted after being unable to practice a craft. He is unfocused after not learning anything. He is unfocused after being away from friends. He is unfocused after being unable to hear eloquent speech. He is unfocused after being unable to practice a martial art. He is unfocused after being unable to practice a skill. He is unfocused after being unable to take it easy. He is untroubled after communing with Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. 
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
