He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt fondness talking with an acquaintance. He was grouchy when caught in the rain. He was content after eating a fine dish. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He felt pleasure near a fine Table. He was bored having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. He was embarrassed after sleeping without a proper room. He felt satisfied at work. He was annoyed after having a drink without using a goblet, cup or mug. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He was annoyed at the lack of dining tables. He felt satisfied after getting into an argument. He felt satisfied at work. He was grouchy dwelling upon being caught in the rain. He didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body.
