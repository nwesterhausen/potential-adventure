### Tholtig Geshudanam, "Tholtig Fortressage", Mason 
 
***

"I need to wear fine things. I feel so dejected..."She is dejected after being unable to be extravagant for so long. She feels self-pity after being away from family for too long. She feels self-pity after being away from friends for too long. She is dejected after being unable to acquire something for too long. She feels self-pity after being unable to make merry for so long. She feels self-pity after being unable to practice a martial art for too long. She is dejected after being unable to take it easy for so long. Within the last season, she felt satisfied at work. She was proud remembering her own fine Bed. She was blissful remembering sleeping in a great bedroom. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied upon improving glassmaking. She was interested near a fine Door. She was proud near her own fine Bed. She was proud near her own fine Seat. She was interested near a fine Door. She felt fondness talking with an acquaintance. She was proud near her own fine Table. She was interested having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. She felt satisfied at work. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was blissful remembering sleeping in a good bedroom. She was content after eating a fine dish. She was blissful dining in a very good dining room. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt insulted after getting into an argument. She was blissful after sleeping in a good bedroom. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was proud remembering her own fine Bed. She felt satisfied at work. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She felt satisfied at work. She was dejected dwelling upon being unable to take it easy for so long. She felt satisfied upon improving masonry. 
***

She is a casual worshipper of Logem the Cardinal. 
***

She is a citizen of The Board of Systems. She is a member of The Stockade of Shanks. She is a former member of The Fellowship of Irons. She is a former member of The Amazing Cuts. She is a former member of The Helmed Company. She arrived at Tathurèrith on the 28th of Sandstone in the year 701. 
***

She is sixty-seven years old, born on the 26th of Granite in the year 635. 
***

She has a grating, raspy voice. Her hair is wavy. Her long hair is tied in a pony tail. Her teeth are crowded. Her eyebrows are extremely sparse. Her eyelashes are quite long. Her head is somewhat broad. Her hair is chestnut. Her skin is tan. Her eyes are silver. 
***

She is indefatigable, very rarely sick and quite quick to heal. 
***

Tholtig Geshudanam likes slate, electrum, brown zircon, clear glass, giant cockatiel leather, the color brown, shields, rings, ducks for their quacks, the words of The Lord of Silver and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, she prefers to consume soft wheat beer and reindeer's milk. She absolutely detests bats. 
***

She has a lot of willpower, but she has a meager ability with social relationships, an iffy memory, a shortage of patience, a little difficulty with words, really poor focus and a lousy intellect. 
***

Like others in her culture, she holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce and values knowledge. She personally would just as soon have nature and the great outdoors burned to ashes and converted into a great mining pit (a strengthening after drinking water without a well in 700), finds the ideas of independence and freedom somewhat foolish and sees no value in holding back complaints and concealing emotions. She dreams of raising a family. 
***

She is frequently depressed, after drinking water without a well in 700. She likes to present herself boldly, even if it would offend an average sense of modesty. She can be very single-minded. She is moved by art and natural beauty, and she is troubled by this since she dislikes the natural world. She is somewhat uncomfortable around those that appear unusual or live differently from herself. She is not particularly interested in what others think of her. She tries to do things correctly each time. She tends not to reveal personal information, though she is conflicted by this as she dislikes this sort of concealment in the abstract. She thinks she is fairly important in the grand scheme of things. She tends to be a little wasteful when working on projects. She tends to ask others for help with difficult decisions. She can handle stress. She points and shakes her finger when she's angry. She needs alcohol to get through the working day. She does not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. She is getting used to tragedy. 
***

Overall, she is untroubled by unmet needs. She is untroubled after spending time with people. She is unfettered after staying occupied. She is unfettered after doing something creative. She is unfocused after leading an unexciting life. She is distracted after being unable to acquire something. She is level-headed after drinking. She is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. She is unfocused after being unable to fight. She is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. She is not distracted after being unable to argue. She is distracted after being unable to be extravagant. She is level-headed after learning something. She is unfocused after being unable to help anybody. She is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. She is distracted after being unable to make merry. She is untroubled after admiring art. She is unfettered after practicing a craft. She is distracted after being away from family. She is distracted after being away from friends. She is distracted after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfettered after practicing a skill. She is distracted after being unable to take it easy. 
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
