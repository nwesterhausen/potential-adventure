***

She is romantically involved with Logem Goldentaxes. She is a casual worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. 
***

She is a citizen of The Board of Systems. She is a member of The Feral Coven. She is a member of The Stockade of Shanks. She is the expedition leader of The Stockade of Shanks. She is the manager of The Stockade of Shanks. She arrived at Tathurèrith on the 4th of Galena in the year 701. 
***

She is sixty-five years old, born on the 8th of Obsidian in the year 637. 
***

She has a thin body with almost no fat on it. Her very long hair is arranged in double braids. She has a scratchy voice. She has a broad chin. Her eyebrows are quite sparse. Her eyelashes are quite long. Her ears are somewhat short. Her hair is chestnut. Her skin is tan. Her eyes are silver. 
***

She is incredibly quick to heal. 
***

Fath Gethfikod likes gneiss, nickel silver, red zircon, picks, tapir men for their floppy noses and the words of The Lord of Silver. When possible, she prefers to consume char and soft wheat beer. She absolutely detests mussels. 
***

She has a great feel for social relationships, a lot of willpower, an ability to read emotions fairly well, a good spatial sense and a way with words, but she has poor focus, poor creativity, little patience and very bad intuition. 
***

Like others in her culture, she holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally strongly believes that a peaceful and ordered society without dissent is best (due to a new romance in 701), sees competition as wasteful and silly, views loyalty unfavorably and doesn't really see the point of working hard. She dreams of raising a family. 
***

She almost never feels discouraged. She lives at a slow-going and leisurely pace. She finds helping others emotionally rewarding. She is assertive. She is pleased by her own appearance and talents. She thinks she is fairly important in the grand scheme of things. She doesn't cling tightly to ideas and is open to changing her mind. She is not particularly interested in what others think of her. She finds obligations confining, and she is conflicted by this since she believes in the importance of the rule of the law. She is slow to trust others. She enjoys the company of others. She has a tendency to go it alone, without considering the advice of others. She isn't given to flights of fancy. She has a calm demeanor. She is stubborn. She rolls her eyes when she's exasperated. She needs alcohol to get through the working day. She likes working outdoors and grumbles only mildly at inclement weather. She is a hardened individual. 
***

Overall, she is unfocused by unmet needs. She is level-headed after spending time with people. She is unfocused after doing nothing creative. She is unfocused after leading an unexciting life. She is unfocused after being unable to acquire something. She is not distracted after being kept from alcohol. She is level-headed after eating a good meal. She is unfocused after being unable to fight. She is untroubled after causing trouble. She is untroubled after arguing. She is unfocused after being unable to be extravagant. She is not distracted after not learning anything. She is unfocused after being unable to help anybody. She is untroubled after thinking abstractly. She is unfocused after being unable to make merry. She is level-headed after admiring art. She is distracted after being unable to practice a craft. She is distracted after being away from family. She is not distracted after being away from friends. She is unfocused after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfettered after practicing a skill. She is unfocused after being unable to take it easy. 
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
