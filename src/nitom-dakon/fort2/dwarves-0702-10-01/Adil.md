Within the last season, she felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was interested near a fine Door. She was bored having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. She felt satisfied at work. She felt wonder after communing with Etur Coppergorges. She felt wonder remembering communing with Etur Coppergorges. She was interested remembering a fine Seat. She felt fondness remembering making a friend. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She felt fondness talking with an acquaintance. She was annoyed after sleeping on a rough cave floor. She was content after eating a fine dish. She was annoyed at the lack of dining tables. She was dejected after being unable to pray to Etur Coppergorges for too long. She felt satisfied after getting into an argument. She felt satisfied upon improving herbalism. She felt satisfied at work. She was dejected when caught in the rain. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She didn't feel anything after seeing a gray langur's dead body. She felt fondness remembering talking with a friend. She felt euphoric due to inebriation.
