  <p>You have arrived.</p>
  <p>
    After a journey from the Mountainhomes into the forbidding wilderness beyond, your harsh trek has finally ended. Your party of seven is to
    make an outpost for the glory of all of Asob Idith. There are almost no supplies left, but with stout labor comes sustenance. Whether by
    bolt, plow or hook, provide for your dwarves.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are expecting a supply caravan just before winter entombs you, but it is Spring now. Enough time to delve secure lodgings, ere the dingo
    men get hungry. A new chapter of dwarven history begins here at this place, Vukcasfikod, "Crescentglazes".

  <p>Strike the earth!</p>
