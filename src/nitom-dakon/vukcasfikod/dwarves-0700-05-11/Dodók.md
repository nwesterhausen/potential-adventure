###   Dodók Stâkudumåm, "Dodók Machinesoared", Peasant  

"I'm feeling randy today!" Within the last season, she felt fondness talking with a friend.  She felt fondness talking with an acquaintance.  She felt fondness  after making a friend.  
***

She is the daughter of Domas Boatsclouted and Kumil Boatsballs.  
***

She is a citizen of The Board of Systems.  She is a member of The Amazing Cuts.  She arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 13th of  Malachite in the year 700.  
***

She is thirty years old, born on the 26th of Slate in the year 670.  
***

She has a once-thin frame, now belarded.  Her slightly rounded silver eyes have large irises.  Her hair is straight.  Her short  hair is neatly combed.  Her ears are somewhat short.  Her head is somewhat short.  Her tan skin is wrinkled.  Her eyebrows are slightly low.  Her hair is chestnut.  
***

She is quite durable and agile, but she is very slow to heal.   
***

Dodók Stâkudumåm likes serpentine, sterling silver, chrysocolla, green glass, black bullhead bone, the color light blue, cabinets, bracelets and llamas for their long necks.  When possible, she prefers to consume fire imp, cranberry wine  and lettuce leaves.  She absolutely detests worms.  
***

She has poor focus and very bad intuition.  
***

Like others in her culture, she has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees  friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds  merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce and finds nature somewhat disturbing.  She personally considers  craftsdwarfship to be relatively worthless, finds the ideas of independence and freedom somewhat foolish, respects perseverance and doesn't see the attainment of knowledge as important.  She dreams of creating a great work of art.   
***

She considers spending time alone much more important than associating with others.  She is obsessed with order and structure in her own life, with everything kept in its proper place.  She lives at a high-energy kinetic pace.  She  occasionally overindulges.  She is somewhat fearful in the face of imminent danger.  She tends to be swayed by the emotions of others.  She often feels lustful.  She does not easily hate or develop negative feelings.  She rarely feels discouraged.   She tends not to reveal personal information.  She can handle stress.  She lowers her eyes when she's angry.  She speaks very deliberately when she's angry.  She needs alcohol to get through the working day.  
***

Overall, she is somewhat  focused with satisfied needs.  She is not distracted after being unoccupied.  She is not distracted after doing nothing creative.  She is not distracted after leading an unexciting life.  She is not distracted  after being unable to acquire something.  She is not distracted after being kept from alcohol.  She is not distracted after a lack of decent meals.  She is not distracted after being unable to fight.  She is not  distracted after a lack of trouble-making.  She is not distracted after being unable to argue.  She is not distracted after being unable to be extravagant.  She is not distracted after not learning anything.  She  is not distracted after being unable to help anybody.  She is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking.  She is not distracted after being unable to make merry.  She is not distracted after being unable to admire  art.  She is not distracted after being away from family.  She is unfettered after being with friends.  She is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art.  She is not distracted after being unable  to practice a skill.  She is not distracted after being unable to take it easy.  
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
