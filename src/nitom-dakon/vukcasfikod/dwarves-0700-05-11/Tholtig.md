###   Tholtig Geshudanam, "Tholtig Fortressage", Craftsdwarf  


"We should all work together."Within the last season, she felt fondness talking with an acquaintance.  
***

She is a casual worshipper of Logem the Cardinal.  
***

She is a citizen of  The Board of Systems.  She is a member of The Fellowship of Irons.  She is a member of The Amazing Cuts.  She arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 13th of Malachite in the year 700.  
***

She is sixty-five years old, born on the 26th of Granite in  the year 635.  
***

She has a grating, raspy voice.  Her hair is wavy.  Her long hair is tied in a pony tail.  Her teeth are crowded.  Her eyebrows are extremely sparse.  Her eyelashes are quite long.  Her head is somewhat broad.  Her hair is  chestnut.  Her skin is tan.  Her eyes are silver.  
***

She is indefatigable, very rarely sick and quite quick to heal.  
***

Tholtig Geshudanam likes slate, electrum, brown zircon, clear glass, giant cockatiel leather, the color  brown, shields, rings, ducks for their quacks, the words of The Lord of Silver and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness.  When possible, she prefers to consume soft wheat beer and reindeer's milk.  She absolutely detests bats.  
***

She has  a lot of willpower, but she has a meager ability with social relationships, an iffy memory, a shortage of patience, a little difficulty with words, quite poor focus and a lousy intellect.  
***

Like others in her culture, she holds  craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes  that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects  fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing.  She personally finds the ideas of independence and freedom somewhat  foolish and sees no value in holding back complaints and concealing emotions.  She dreams of raising a family.  
***

She likes to present herself boldly, even if it would offend an average sense of modesty.  She can be very  single-minded.  She is moved by art and natural beauty, and she is troubled by this since she dislikes the natural world.  She is somewhat uncomfortable around those that appear unusual or live differently from herself.  She is not particularly  interested in what others think of her.  She tries to do things correctly each time.  She tends not to reveal personal information, though she is conflicted by this as she dislikes this sort of concealment in the abstract.  She thinks she is fairly  important in the grand scheme of things.  She tends to be a little wasteful when working on projects.  She tends to ask others for help with difficult decisions.  She can handle stress.  She points and shakes her finger when she's angry.  She needs  alcohol to get through the working day.  
***

Overall, she is somewhat focused with satisfied needs.  She is unfettered after spending time with people.  She is not distracted after being unoccupied.  She is not  distracted after doing nothing creative.  She is not distracted after leading an unexciting life.  She is not distracted after being unable to acquire something.  She is unfocused after being kept from alcohol.   She is not distracted after a lack of decent meals.  She is not distracted after being unable to fight.  She is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making.  She is not distracted after being unable to argue.   She is not distracted after being unable to be extravagant.  She is not distracted after not learning anything.  She is not distracted after being unable to help anybody.  She is not distracted after a lack of  abstract thinking.  She is not distracted after being unable to make merry.  She is not distracted after being unable to admire art.  She is not distracted after being unable to practice a craft.  She is not  distracted after being away from family.  She is not distracted after being away from friends.  She is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art.  She is not distracted after being unable to practice a  skill.  She is not distracted after being unable to take it easy.  
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
