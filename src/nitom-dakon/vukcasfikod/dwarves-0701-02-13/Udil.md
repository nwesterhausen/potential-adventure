### Udil Odgúbrimtar, "Udil Mobcastles", Bone Carver 
 
***

"I've been fine."Within the last season, he didn't feel anything near a fine Table. He didn't feel anything near a fine Seat. He didn't feel anything near a fine Seat. He felt satisfied at work. 
***

He is a dubious worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. 
***

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Righteous Cult. He is a member of The Amazing Cuts. He arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 5th of Slate in the year 701. 
***

He is fifty-one years old, born on the 23rd of Moonstone in the year 650. 
***

His sideburns are clean-shaven. His very long moustache is neatly combed. His very long beard is neatly combed. His long hair is arranged in double braids. He has a fairly deep and raspy voice. His ears are very short. His silver eyes are slightly sunken. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. 
***

He is very slow to tire. 
***

Udil Odgúbrimtar likes gabbro, platinum, yellow zircon, eagle leather, the color pale blue, dodecahedra, flasks, rabbits for their ears, chimpanzees for their antics, the sound of The Bewildering Periwinkle and the sight of The Mellow Glimmer. When possible, he prefers to consume giant mongoose, plump helmets and sunshine. He absolutely detests jumping spiders. 
***

He has a great sense of empathy, the ability to focus, a good spatial sense and a good intellect, but he has bad intuition and a poor memory. 
***

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally values tradition, respects perseverance and does not particularly value the truth. He dreams of creating a great work of art. 
***

He has a low sense of self-esteem. He dislikes obligations and will try to avoid being bound by them, though he is conflicted by this for more than one reason. He is rarely happy or enthusiastic, and he is conflicted by this as he values parties and merrymaking in the abstract. He often acts with compassion. He has a greedy streak. He doesn't cling tightly to ideas and is open to changing his mind. He tries to keep his things orderly. He doesn't tend to hold on to grievances. He is quick to anger. He occasionally overindulges. He isn't particularly curious about the world. He has a tendency toward forming deep emotional bonds with others. He drums his fingers when he's trying to remember something. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. 
***

Overall, he is somewhat focused with satisfied needs. He is not distracted after being away from people. He is unfettered after staying occupied. He is unfettered after doing something creative. He is not distracted after leading an unexciting life. He is not distracted after being unable to acquire something. He is unfocused after being kept from alcohol. He is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not distracted after being unable to argue. He is not distracted after being unable to be extravagant. He is not distracted after being unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. He is not distracted after being unable to make merry. He is unfettered after admiring art. He is unfettered after practicing a craft. He is not distracted after not learning anything. He is not distracted after being away from family. He is not distracted after being away from friends. He is not distracted after being away from traditions. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art. He is unfettered after practicing a skill. He is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. 
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
