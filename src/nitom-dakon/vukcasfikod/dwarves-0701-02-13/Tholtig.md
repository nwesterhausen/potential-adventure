Tholtig Geshudanam likes slate, electrum, brown zircon, clear glass, giant cockatiel leather, the color brown, shields, rings, ducks for their quacks, the words of The Lord of Silver and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, she prefers to consume soft wheat beer and reindeer's milk. She absolutely detests bats. 
***

She has a lot of willpower, but she has a meager ability with social relationships, an iffy memory, a shortage of patience, a little difficulty with words, quite poor focus and a lousy intellect.

She likes to present herself boldly, even if it would offend an average sense of modesty. She can be very single-minded.
