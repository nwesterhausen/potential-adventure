***

Her very long hair is arranged in double braids. She has a fairly deep and raspy voice. She has very low cheekbones. Her somewhat short ears are somewhat splayed out. Her eyebrows are extremely sparse. Her hair is chestnut. Her skin is tan. Her eyes are silver. 
***

***

Nil Adilb没nem likes serpentine, bismuth bronze, cherry opal, beaver tooth, giant bluejay bone, anvils, donkeys for their stubborness and the sound of The Phrases of Sparkling. When possible, she prefers to consume gutter cruor and squashes. She absolutely detests oysters. 
***

She has a great affinity for language, a great feel for the surrounding space, very good focus and a great memory, but she has poor analytical abilities and very bad intuition. 
***

Like others in her culture, she holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally is put off by family and doesn't really value merrymaking. She dreams of creating a great work of art. 
***

She is unfriendly and disagreeable, and she is bothered by this since she values friendship. She is not inherently proud of her talents and accomplishments. She often acts with compassion. She tends to consider what others think of her. She has a tendency toward forming deep emotional bonds with others. She isn't given to flights of fancy. She has a tendency to go it alone, without considering the advice of others. She is curious and eager to learn. She tends to avoid any physical confrontations, and she works to square this natural tendency with her respect of martial prowess. She sometimes acts with little determination and confidence. She finds obligations confining, though she is conflicted by this for more than one reason. She exhales slowly and deliberately when she starts getting bored. She begins to talk in a hushed whisper when she is angry. She needs alcohol to get through the working day. 
***

She is not distracted after being away from friends. She is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfettered after practicing a skill. She is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. She is not distracted after being unable to pray to Logem the Cardinal. 
***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
