She was interested near a fine Seat. She was interested having an intellectual discussion with an acquaintance. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was uneasy after being kept from alcohol for too long. She was content after sleeping in a good bedroom. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She was annoyed after drinking water without a well. She felt satisfied at work. She was content dining in a great dining room. She felt satisfied at work. She felt bitter after getting into an argument.

***

She is a citizen of The Board of Systems. She is a member of The Doctrine of Rock. She is a member of The Amazing Cuts. She arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 2nd of Timber in the year 700. 
***

She is seventy-seven years old, born on the 6th of Timber in the year 624. 
***

Her hair is curly. Her very long hair is tied in a pony tail. Her somewhat short ears are splayed out. She has a scratchy voice. Her teeth are crowded. Her eyebrows are quite sparse. Her head is somewhat broad. Her hair is chestnut. Her skin is tan. Her eyes are silver. 
***

She is almost never sick, but she is slow to heal and very quick to tire. 
***

Ducim Enshalsåkzul likes schist, billon, carnelian, cap hopper leather, the color lilac, waves, bolts, querns, bracelets and vultures for their patience. When possible, she prefers to consume bushmaster, raspberry wine and cucumbers. She absolutely detests bats. 
***

She has a great affinity for language, a deep well of patience and very good creativity, but she has poor focus, a questionable spatial sense, a poor memory and little natural inclination toward music. 
***

Like others in her culture, she holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, values cooperation, values martial prowess, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally disdains loyalty, sees war as a useful means to an end, does not care about fairness and doesn't think one way or the other about leisure time. She dreams of crafting a masterwork someday, and this dream was realized. 
***

She is greatly moved by art and natural beauty, and she is troubled by this since she dislikes the natural world. She has an overbearing personality. She has an active sense of humor. She has an active imagination. She doesn't often experience strong cravings or urges. She tends to share her own experiences and thoughts with others. She takes offered help and gifts without feeling particularly grateful. She is somewhat uncomfortable around those that appear unusual or live differently from herself. She is trusting. She can handle stress. Her hands move frantically when she's trying to remember something. She needs alcohol to get through the working day. She does not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. 
***

Overall, she is unfocused by unmet needs. She is not distracted after being away from people. She is unfocused after being unoccupied. She is unfocused after doing nothing creative. She is unfocused after leading an unexciting life. She is unfocused after being unable to acquire something. She is unfocused after being unable to fight. She is unfocused after a lack of trouble-making. She is unfocused after being unable to argue. She is unfocused after being unable to be extravagant. She is unfocused after not learning anything. She is unfocused after being unable to help anybody. She is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. She is unfocused after being unable to make merry.

She is not distracted after being away from friends. She is unfocused after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfocused after being unable to practice a skill.

***

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
