Solon Olintun likes native aluminum, steel, cinnamon grossular, giant king cobra bone, linen paper, bracelets, water buffalos for their water wallowing, white-handed gibbons for their ability to swing through the trees, the words of The Lark of Crabs and the sight of The Mellow Glimmer. When possible, he prefers to consume giant hedgehog, yellow bullhead, parsnip wine, maize flour and flax seeds. He absolutely detests hamsters.
