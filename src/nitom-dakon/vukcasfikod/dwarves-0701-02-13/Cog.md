***

"You should always tell the truth."Within the last season, he felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He felt fondness talking with an acquaintance. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Bridge. 
***

He is a faithful worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts. 
***

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Cult of Flickering. He is a member of The Amazing Cuts. He arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 5th of Slate in the year 701. 
***

He is seventy-one years old, born on the 4th of Opal in the year 630. 
***

His long sideburns are braided. His very long moustache is arranged in double braids. His very long beard is arranged in double braids. His hair is clean-shaven. He has a low voice. His eyelashes are quite long. His ears are somewhat short. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver. 
***

He is absolutely inexhaustible, almost never sick and quite durable, but he is very slow to heal. 
***

Cog Erallek likes orthoclase, nickel silver, shell opal, giant sloth leather, sea otter tooth, crossbows, leggings, tables, figurines, wombats for their waddle, the words of The Autumnal Drink of Woods and the sound of The Bewildering Periwinkle. When possible, he prefers to consume pig, oyster and guava wine. He absolutely detests toads. 
***

He has a great feel for the surrounding space and a great deal of patience, but he has meager creativity, poor empathy, little natural inclination toward music and a poor memory.

He personally is somewhat put off by trade and commerce and doesn't respect a society that has settled into harmony without debate and strife. He dreams of mastering a skill. 
***

He is completely oblivious to any conception of neatness and will just leave things strewn about without a care. He takes no pleasure in his talents and appearance. He is brave in the face of imminent danger. He has a greedy streak. He can handle stress. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. 
***
