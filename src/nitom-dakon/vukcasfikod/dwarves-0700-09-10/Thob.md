"It's not perfect, but it's good enough. Why fret about it?"Within the last season, she felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt pleasure remembering a fine Trade Depot. She felt fondness talking with an acquaintance. She felt satisfied after getting into an argument. She felt pleasure near a fine Seat. She felt pleasure near a fine Table. She felt pleasure near a fine Seat. She felt pleasure near a fine Trade Depot. She didn't feel anything while in conflict. 
***

She is a faithful worshipper of Logem the Cardinal.

***

She is indefatigable. 
***

Thob Obokudil likes calcite, brass, black opal, gems, blowdarts, gauntlets, guineafowls for their social nature, two-humped camel men for their humps, the sound of The Phrases of Sparkling and the sight of The Saffron of Styling. When possible, she prefers to consume passion fruit wine. She absolutely detests brown recluse spiders. 
***

She has a great sense of empathy, a very good sense of the position of her own body, a natural inclination toward language, a sum of patience and the ability to focus, but she has very bad analytical abilities. 
***

Like others in her culture, she has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally believes that those who sacrifice for others should be deeply respected, strongly values tranquility and quiet, finds introspection to be a waste of time and values good craftsdwarfship. She dreams of mastering a skill. 
***

She is driven by a bouncing frenetic energy. She prefers to be alone. She is intellectually stubborn, rarely changing her mind during a debate regardless of the merits. She is confident under pressure. She is not careful with resources when working on projects and often spends unnecessary effort. She is very rarely moved by curiosity. She is inattentive to detail in her own work. She is often nervous. She has an active imagination. She generally acts with a narrow focus on the current activity. She has a tendency to go it alone, without considering the advice of others. She is not particularly interested in what others think of her. She is somewhat quarrelsome, and she is bothered by this since she values friendship. She has a sense of duty. She doesn't focus on material goods. She needs alcohol to get through the working day. 
***

Overall, she is somewhat focused with satisfied needs. She is unfettered after staying occupied. She is unfettered after doing something creative. She is not distracted after leading an unexciting life. She is unfocused after being kept from alcohol. She is not distracted after a lack of decent meals.

She is level-headed after admiring art. She is not distracted after being unable to practice a craft. She is not distracted after not learning anything. She is unfocused after being away from family. She is unfocused after being away from friends. She is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfettered after practicing a skill. She is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. She is unfocused after being unable to pray to Logem the Cardinal.
