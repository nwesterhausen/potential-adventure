"There's so much to be done!"Within the last season, he felt satisfied at work. He felt fondness talking with a friend. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He felt pleasure near a fine Table. He felt pleasure near a fine Table. He felt pleasure near a fine Table. He was annoyed after drinking water without a well. He was blissful remembering sleeping in a good bedroom. He felt love remembering a new romance. He felt satisfied at work. He felt euphoric due to inebriation. He was blissful after sleeping in a good bedroom. He was blissful dining in a great dining room. He felt pleasure near a fine Seat. He was interested having an intellectual discussion with a friend. He was annoyed after having a drink without using a goblet, cup or mug. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt pleasure near a fine Door. He felt satisfied at work. He felt restless after being unable to practice a craft for too long. He felt bitter after getting into an argument. He felt pleasure near his own fine Bed. He felt satisfied at work. He felt fondness remembering talking with a friend. He felt satisfied upon improving mining.

ònul Idokcilob likes cryolite, bismuth bronze, wax opal, the color taupe gray, gauntlets, scepters, the words of The Lark of Crabs and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, he prefers to consume giant platypus and strawberry wine. He absolutely detests leeches. 
***

He has a great feel for the surrounding space, a lot of willpower and good intuition, but he has little linguistic ability, poor creativity and a poor memory. 
***

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing.
