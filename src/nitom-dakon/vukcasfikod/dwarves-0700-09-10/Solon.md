"I finished up some work. That was satisfying."He feels satisfied at work. Within the last season, he felt satisfied at work. He was annoyed after drinking water without a well. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He didn't feel anything dining in a great dining room. He didn't feel anything due to inebriation. He didn't feel anything after sleeping in a good bedroom. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied at work. He didn't feel anything due to inebriation. He was irritated eating at a crowded table. He felt fondness remembering talking with a friend. He felt satisfied upon improving mining. He felt love remembering a new romance. He felt satisfied at work. He felt satisfied upon improving stone crafting.

He is romantically involved with Ã²nul Pointedroof. He is a casual worshipper of Doren Ivoryfortunes the Diamond Taxes. 
***

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Cult of Wealth. He is a member of The Amazing Cuts. He arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 15th of Granite in the year 700. 
***

He is fifty-eight years old, born on the 7th of Granite in the year 642. 
***

He has what was once a thin frame, now bearing enormous, thick layers of fat. His very long sideburns are braided. His very long moustache is arranged in double braids. His very long beard is arranged in double braids. His very short hair is neatly combed. His head is extremely tall. His teeth are crowded. His eyelashes are quite long. His eyebrows are quite sparse. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver. 
***

He is strong, but he is quite susceptible to disease and very slow to heal. 
***

Solon Olintun likes native aluminum, steel, cinnamon grossular, giant king cobra bone, linen paper, bracelets, water buffalos for their water wallowing, white-handed gibbons for their ability to swing through the trees, the words of The Lark of Crabs and the sight of The Mellow Glimmer. When possible, he prefers to consume giant hedgehog, yellow bullhead, parsnip wine, maize flour and flax seeds. He absolutely detests hamsters. 
***

He has an amazing memory and a very good sense of empathy, but he has a meager ability with social relationships, bad intuition and little linguistic ability. 
***

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally finds maintaining decorum a silly, fumbling waste of time. He dreams of raising a family. 
***

He can be very single-minded. He is very stubborn. He rarely looks on others with lust. He prefers to present himself modestly. He is rarely happy or enthusiastic, and he is conflicted by this as he values parties and merrymaking in the abstract. He is not particularly interested in what others think of him. He is quick to form negative views about things. He tends to think before acting. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. He likes working outdoors and grumbles only mildly at inclement weather. 
***

Overall, he is unfocused by unmet needs. He is unfocused after being away from people. He is unfettered after staying occupied. He is unfettered after doing something creative. He is unfocused after leading an unexciting life. He is unfocused after being unable to acquire something. He is unfocused after being kept from alcohol. He is unfocused after a lack of decent meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is unfocused after a lack of trouble-making. He is unfocused after being unable to argue. He is not distracted after not learning anything. He is not distracted after being unable to help anybody. He is unfocused after a lack of abstract thinking. He is unfocused after being unable to make merry. He is unfocused after being unable to admire art. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a craft. He is unfocused after being away from family. He is unfocused after being away from friends. He is unfocused after being unable to practice a martial art. He is unfettered after practicing a skill. He is unfocused after being unable to take it easy. 
***
