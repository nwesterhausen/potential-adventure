When possible, she prefers to consume moose, muck roots, teff beer and flax flour. She absolutely detests brown recluse spiders. 
***

She has a lot of willpower, but she has poor focus and bad intuition. 
***

Like others in her culture, she has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally thinks that the entire concept of sacrifice for others is truly disgusting, values peace over war and considers craftsdwarfship to be relatively worthless. She dreams of raising a family. 
***

She can be very single-minded. She is very friendly and always tries to say nice things to others. She is not the type to fall in love or even develop positive feelings. She can sometimes act without deliberation. She rarely feels discouraged. She tends to be a bit stubborn in changing her mind about things. She tenses up when she's nervous. She needs alcohol to get through the working day.
