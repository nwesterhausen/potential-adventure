"I'm at my best under pressure."Within the last season, she felt fondness remembering making a friend. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She was annoyed after drinking water without a well. She was embarrassed after sleeping without a proper room. She was blissful remembering dining in a great dining room. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied upon improving mining. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was interested near a fine Table. She was interested near a fine Seat. She was interested near a fine Seat. She was blissful dining in a great dining room. She felt satisfied at work. She felt satisfied at work. She felt euphoric due to inebriation. She was annoyed after having a drink without using a goblet, cup or mug. She was frustrated after getting into an argument. She was interested near a fine Table. She was interested near a fine Table. She felt satisfied after felling a tree. She was annoyed after being pestered by flies. She felt satisfied at work.

Her ears are somewhat short. Her head is somewhat short. Her tan skin is wrinkled. Her eyebrows are slightly low. Her hair is chestnut.

***

She has poor focus and very bad intuition. 
***

Like others in her culture, she has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally considers craftsdwarfship to be relatively worthless, finds the ideas of independence and freedom somewhat foolish, respects perseverance and doesn't see the attainment of knowledge as important. She dreams of creating a great work of art.

She considers spending time alone much more important than associating with others. She is obsessed with order and structure in her own life, with everything kept in its proper place. She lives at a high-energy kinetic pace. She occasionally overindulges. She is somewhat fearful in the face of imminent danger. She tends to be swayed by the emotions of others. She often feels lustful. She does not easily hate or develop negative feelings. She rarely feels discouraged. She tends not to reveal personal information. She can handle stress. She lowers her eyes when she's angry. She speaks very deliberately when she's angry. She needs alcohol to get through the working day.

She is unfocused after a lack of abstract thinking. She is unfocused after being unable to make merry. She is not distracted after being unable to admire art. She is unfocused after being away from family. She is unfocused after being away from friends. She is unfocused after being unable to practice a martial art. She is unfettered after practicing a skill. She is unfocused after being unable to take it easy.
