Tholtig Geshudanam likes slate, electrum, brown zircon, clear glass, giant cockatiel leather, the color brown, shields, rings, ducks for their quacks, the words of The Lord of Silver and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, she prefers to consume soft wheat beer and reindeer's milk. She absolutely detests bats.

She likes to present herself boldly, even if it would offend an average sense of modesty. She can be very single-minded.

She is somewhat uncomfortable around those that appear unusual or live differently from herself. She is not particularly interested in what others think of her. She tries to do things correctly each time. She tends not to reveal personal information, though she is conflicted by this as she dislikes this sort of concealment in the abstract. She thinks she is fairly important in the grand scheme of things. She tends to be a little wasteful when working on projects. She tends to ask others for help with difficult decisions. She can handle stress. She points and shakes her finger when she's angry. She needs alcohol to get through the working day.
