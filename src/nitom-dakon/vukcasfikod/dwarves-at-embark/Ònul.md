double braids. His hair is clean-shaven. He has a grating, raspy voice. His teeth are crowded. He is average in size.
His ears are somewhat short. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver.

---

He is indefatigable.

---

ònul Idokcilob likes cryolite, bismuth bronze, wax opal, the color taupe gray, gauntlets, scepters, the words of The
Lark of Crabs and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, he prefers to consume giant platypus and
strawberry wine. He absolutely detests leeches.

---

He has a great feel for the surrounding space, a lot of willpower and good intuition, but he has little linguistic
ability, a poor memory and poor creativity.

---

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and
their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees
friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their
works, really respects those that take the time to master a skill, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities,
respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and
finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally values hard work, sees sacrifice as wasteful and foolish and does not
really value skills related to fighting. He dreams of raising a family.

---

He is vengeful and never forgets or forgives past grievances. He actively avoids exciting or stressful situations. He is
not a private person and freely shares details of his life. He is rarely jealous. He sometimes acts with little
determination and confidence. He is not inherently proud of his talents and accomplishments. He lives a fast-paced life.
He is often nervous. He has little interest in joking around. He does not have a great aesthetic sensitivity, and he is
conflicted by this as he values artwork and its creation. When he's nervous, he has a habit of chewing on his cheek. He
needs alcohol to get through the working day. He likes working outdoors and grumbles only mildly at inclement weather.

---

Overall, he is untroubled by unmet needs. He is not distracted after being away from people. He is not distracted after
being unoccupied. He is not distracted after being unable to acquire something. He is not distracted after being kept
from alcohol. He is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is
not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not distracted after being unable to argue. He is not distracted
after being unable to be extravagant. He is not distracted after not learning anything. He is not distracted after being
unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. He is not distracted after being unable
to make merry. He is not distracted after being unable to admire art. He is not distracted after being unable to
practice a craft. He is not distracted after being away from family. He is not distracted after being away from friends.
He is not distracted after being unable to practice a skill. He is not distracted after being unable to take it easy.

---

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
