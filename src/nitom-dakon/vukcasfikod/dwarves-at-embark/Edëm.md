He is a faithful worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts.

teeth are crowded. His eyebrows are quite sparse. His tan skin is wrinkled. His head is somewhat broad. His hair is

Edëm Oddomthad likes stibnite, sterling silver, demantoid, giant capuchin leather, cave spider silk, donkeys for their
stubborness, the sound of The Phrases of Sparkling and the sight of The Festival of Sweetness. When possible, he prefers
to consume giant spider monkey and date wine. He absolutely detests worms.

---

He has an amazing memory, a very good sense of the position of his own body and very good focus, but he has bad
intuition and an iffy sense for music.

---

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and
their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees
friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their
works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities,
respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge
and finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally sees competition as reasonably important, doesn't care if others
take the time to master skills and doesn't see cooperation as valuable. He dreams of raising a family.

---

He considers spending time alone much more important than associating with others. He is somewhat scatterbrained. He
does not easily fall in love and rarely develops positive sentiments. He often feels envious of others. He is quick to
form negative views about things. He tends to be a little tight with resources when working on projects. He tries to
keep his things orderly. He occasionally overindulges. He tries to do things correctly each time. He needs alcohol to
get through the working day. He likes working outdoors and grumbles only mildly at inclement weather.

---

Overall, he is untroubled by unmet needs. He is not distracted after being unoccupied. He is not distracted after doing
nothing creative. He is not distracted after leading an unexciting life. He is not distracted after being unable to
acquire something. He is not distracted after being kept from alcohol. He is not distracted after a lack of decent
meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not
distracted after being unable to argue. He is not distracted after being unable to be extravagant. He is not distracted
after not learning anything. He is not distracted after being unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack
of abstract thinking. He is not distracted after being unable to make merry. He is not distracted after being unable to
admire art. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a craft. He is not distracted after being away from
family. He is not distracted after being away from friends. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a
martial art. He is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. He is not distracted after being unable to pray to
Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts.
