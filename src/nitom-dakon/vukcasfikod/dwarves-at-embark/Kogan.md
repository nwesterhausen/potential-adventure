### Kogan Rakustil, "Kogan Tombwords", Gem Setter

---

"Everything's alright."

---

She is a worshipper of Zulban the Brilliant.

---

She is a citizen of The Board of Systems. She is a member of The Remarkable Cult. She is a member of The Amazing Cuts.
She arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 15th of Granite in the year 700.

---

She is seventy-seven years old, born on the 14th of Moonstone in the year 623.

---

She has a thin body with little fat. She has a fairly deep and raspy voice. Her hair is clean-shaven. Her teeth are
crowded. Her ears are short. Her hair is chestnut. Her skin is tan. Her eyes are silver.

---

She is quick to heal, but she is susceptible to disease.

---

Kogan Rakustil likes hornblende, nickel silver, red tourmaline, giant ibex hoof, the color olive, picks, cages and the
sound of The Phrases of Sparkling. When possible, she prefers to consume blind cave bear, apricot wine and dwarven
syrup. She absolutely detests jumping spiders.

---

She has very good creativity, but she has poor empathy, little patience and little natural inclination toward music.

---

Like others in her culture, she holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and
their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees
friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their
works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill,
finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values martial prowess,
values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. She personally finds
introspection to be a waste of time, finds those that deny their impulses somewhat stiff and doesn't see cooperation as
valuable. She dreams of mastering a skill.

---

She is very impolite and inconsiderate of propriety. She almost never feels discouraged. She does not trust others. She
is very humble. She often feels lustful. She generally acts impartially and is rarely moved to mercy. She is often
nervous. She is somewhat quarrelsome, and she is bothered by this since she values friendship. She has an active sense
of humor. She is stubborn. She tries to do things correctly each time. She is not inherently proud of her talents and
accomplishments. She is not particularly interested in what others think of her. She occasionally overindulges. She
needs alcohol to get through the working day. She likes working outdoors and grumbles only mildly at inclement weather.

---

Overall, she is untroubled by unmet needs. She is not distracted after being away from people. She is not distracted
after being unoccupied. She is not distracted after doing nothing creative. She is not distracted after leading an
unexciting life. She is not distracted after being unable to acquire something. She is not distracted after being kept
from alcohol. She is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. She is not distracted after being unable to fight. She
is not distracted after a lack of trouble-making. She is not distracted after being unable to argue. She is not
distracted after being unable to be extravagant. She is not distracted after not learning anything. She is not
distracted after being unable to help anybody. She is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. She is not
distracted after being unable to make merry. She is not distracted after being unable to admire art. She is not
distracted after being unable to practice a craft. She is not distracted after being away from family. She is not
distracted after being away from friends. She is not distracted after being unable to practice a martial art. She is not
distracted after being unable to practice a skill. She is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. She is not
distracted after being unable to pray to Zulban the Brilliant.

---

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
