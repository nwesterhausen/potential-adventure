### Solon Olintun, "Solon Tongsdoors", Mason

---

"I feel fine."

---

He is a casual worshipper of Doren Ivoryfortunes the Diamond Taxes.

---

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Cult of Wealth. He is a member of The Amazing Cuts. He
arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 15th of Granite in the year 700.

---

He is fifty-eight years old, born on the 7th of Granite in the year 642.

---

He has a once-thin frame, now belarded. His very long sideburns are braided. His very long moustache is arranged in
double braids. His very long beard is arranged in double braids. His very short hair is neatly combed. His head is
extremely tall. His teeth are crowded. His eyelashes are quite long. His eyebrows are quite sparse. His hair is
chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver.

---

He is strong, but he is quite susceptible to disease and very slow to heal.

---

Solon Olintun likes native aluminum, steel, cinnamon grossular, giant king cobra bone, linen paper, bracelets, water
buffalos for their water wallowing, white-handed gibbons for their ability to swing through the trees, the words of The
Lark of Crabs and the sight of The Mellow Glimmer. When possible, he prefers to consume giant hedgehog, yellow bullhead,
parsnip wine, maize flour and flax seeds. He absolutely detests hamsters.

---

He has an amazing memory and a very good sense of empathy, but he has a meager ability with social relationships, bad
intuition and little linguistic ability.

---

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and
their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees
friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their
works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, really respects those that take the time to master a skill,
finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values
martial prowess, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and finds nature somewhat disturbing. He
personally finds maintaining decorum a silly, fumbling waste of time. He dreams of raising a family.

---

He can be very single-minded. He is very stubborn. He rarely looks on others with lust. He prefers to present himself
modestly. He is rarely happy or enthusiastic, and he is conflicted by this as he values parties and merrymaking in the
abstract. He is not particularly interested in what others think of him. He is quick to form negative views about
things. He tends to think before acting. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. He likes working outdoors and
grumbles only mildly at inclement weather.

---

Overall, he is untroubled by unmet needs. He is not distracted after being away from people. He is not distracted after
being unoccupied. He is not distracted after doing nothing creative. He is not distracted after leading an unexciting
life. He is not distracted after being unable to acquire something. He is not distracted after being kept from alcohol.
He is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is not
distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not distracted after being unable to argue. He is not distracted after
not learning anything. He is not distracted after being unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack of
abstract thinking. He is not distracted after being unable to make merry. He is not distracted after being unable to
admire art. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a craft. He is not distracted after being away from
family. He is not distracted after being away from friends. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a
martial art. He is not distracted after being unable to practice a skill. He is not distracted after being unable to
take it easy.

---

A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry.
