### Astesh Konosulåb, "Astesh Brasssquirt", expedition leader

---

"It's best to slow down and just relax."

---

He is a worshipper of Izeg the Rapidity of Nuts.

---

He is a citizen of The Board of Systems. He is a member of The Righteous Cult. He is a member of The Amazing Cuts. He is
the expedition leader of The Amazing Cuts. He arrived at Vukcasfikod on the 15th of Granite in the year 700.

---

He is fifty-eight years old, born on the 23rd of Timber in the year 642.

---

He is very fat. His sideburns are clean-shaven. His very long moustache is arranged in double braids. His very long
beard is arranged in double braids. His very long hair is braided. He has a broad chin. He has a scratchy voice. His
ears are short. His eyelashes are quite long. His hair is chestnut. His skin is tan. His eyes are silver.

---

He is incredibly tough, but he is weak and very slow to heal.

---

Astesh Konosulåb likes hematite, iron, peridot, giant otter leather, giant bushtit tooth, the color purple, gauntlets,
caps, guineafowls for their social nature, dark gnomes for their ability to hold liquor, cranberry vines for their
fruit, the words of The Lord of Silver and the sight of The Mellow Glimmer. When possible, he prefers to consume lynx,
two-grain wheat beer and pecans. He absolutely detests rats.

---

He has a feel for music, but he has a shortage of patience, little willpower and very bad analytical abilities.

---

Like others in his culture, he holds craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrates talented artisans and
their masterworks, has a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prizes loyalty, values family greatly, sees
friendship as one of the finer things in life, believes that honesty is a high ideal, greatly respects artists and their
works, deeply respects those that work hard at their labors, finds merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities,
respects fair-dealing and fair-play, values cooperation, values leisure time, respects commerce, values knowledge and
finds nature somewhat disturbing. He personally finds eloquence and artful speech off-putting, does not really value
skills related to fighting and doesn't care if others take the time to master skills. He dreams of raising a family.

---

He is not the type to fall in love or even develop positive feelings. He generally finds himself quite hopeful about the
future. He is quick to anger. He could be considered rude. He has a calm demeanor. He can handle stress. He likes to
brawl. He doesn't try to get things done perfectly. He is quite ambitious. He is trusting. He thinks he is fairly
important in the grand scheme of things. He needs alcohol to get through the working day. He likes working outdoors and
grumbles only mildly at inclement weather.

---

Overall, he is untroubled by unmet needs. He is not distracted after being away from people. He is not distracted after
being unoccupied. He is not distracted after doing nothing creative. He is not distracted after leading an unexciting
life. He is not distracted after being unable to acquire something. He is not distracted after being kept from alcohol.
He is not distracted after a lack of decent meals. He is not distracted after being unable to fight. He is not
distracted after a lack of trouble-making. He is not distracted after being unable to argue. He is not distracted after
being unable to be extravagant. He is not distracted after not learning anything. He is not distracted after being
unable to help anybody. He is not distracted after a lack of abstract thinking. He is not distracted after being unable
to make merry. He is not distracted after being unable to admire art. He is not distracted after being unable to
practice a craft. He is not distracted after being away from family. He is not distracted after being away from friends.
He is not distracted after being unable to take it easy. He is not distracted after being unable to pray to Izeg the
Rapidity of Nuts.
