  You have arrived. After a journey from the Mountainhomes into the forbidding wilderness beyond, your harsh trek has finally ended. Your party
  of seven is to make an outpost for the glory of all of Asob Idith (civ name). There are almost no supplies left, but with stout labor comes
  sustenance. Whether by bolt, plow or hook, provide for your dwarves. You are expecting a supply caravan just before winter entombs you, but it
  is Spring now. Enough time to delve secure lodgings, ere the dingo men get hungry. A new chapter of dwarven history begins here at this place,
  Vukcasfikod, "Crescentglazes". Strike the earth!
